# Review and Introduction

## Is Group Formation Good or Bad for Deliberation?

Before diving into today's reading, let's start by noting an emerging problem. 

It seems clear that the Internet is providing new avenues for group formation. 

As noted by both Lessig and Shapiro, this group formation is an important tool that enables individuals to speak who would not have otherwise done so.

{:.rquestion} 
As review, can you think of some examples that support this aspect of group formation?

From a Habermasian perspective, this kind of group formation would seem to be a good thing. The public sphere is distorted when individuals are NOT equally "free" (here we might think of freedom as "enabled" or "empowered") to express their own opinion. In the language of Sunstein, such expression expands the "pool of arguments and opinions in the public sphere", and such expansion improves the results of deliberation.

At the same time, Sunstein is now giving considerable attention to the ways group formation can have the reverse effect. Group membership can also produce "group think" which in turn has a constraining effect on individual speech. While consumers may remain able to choose, their choices are influenced by the group and what they choose to say becomes increasingly determined by what others in the group say. This effect of group membership reduces the "pool of arguments and opinions in the public sphere" which would seem to worsen the conditions for deliberation.

In the latter case, there are two valences to the idea of "more speech". There might be more speech "quantitatively" (i.e. more voices speaking) but there is less speech "qualitatively" (fewer perspectives represented). 

This relationship between the quantity of speech and quality (not quality in terms of good or bad, but quality as in "qualis" for "what kind" or "what sort") appears to be at the heart of the tension Sunstein is exploring in today's reading. It also is at the heart of the question we've been asking for a while now, namely, "whether 'more speech' always equals better deliberation"? 

Answering this question requires reflection on what we mean by "more". In these chapters Sunstein seems particularly attentive to the way the Internet is rapidly expanding the "quantitative" possibilities of speech. And while this can sometimes correlate with an increase in types of speech (quality), Sunstein is at pains to identify ways that the speed, scale, and subsequent filtering of that speech is reducing the amount of qualitative speech within the public sphere.

A critical task for us as potential policy makers is to be attentive the communication conditions that are enabling group formation beneficial to deliberation and at the same time aware of the conditions that are creating groups which are harmful to deliberation.

With this in mind, we as policy makers can then use the tools at our disposal (law, market, norms, code) to try to encourage those conditions that have a positive effect and suppress those conditions that have a negative effect.

## Ideal Speech Conditions

This attempt to identify conditions is what Habermas sometimes refers to as ["Ideal Speech Situation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_speech_situation). Defining such a situation seems to be part of what Sunstein attempts to identify when he distinguishes between "deliberative enclaves" and "polarized" groups. (See Sunstein, c3, pp. 85-88)

To help us appreciate Sunstein's reflections on the forces of polarization vis-a-vis enclave formation, let's first review what Habermas thinks is needed for good deliberation and then turn to Sunstein's description of some of the new modalities of the Internet that threaten these conditions.

There seem to be two things necessary:

1. Everyone freely speaks 
2. Speech is spoken in such a way that its "deliberative reverberation" (my phrase) can be felt and incorporated into subsequent speech. 

**1. Speaking Freely**

As we've discussed the conditions necessary to allow everyone to freely speak are not so easy to attain. The ability of private citizens to freely express themselves on public matters is threatened by both the direct interference of administrative power and indirectly through the manipulation of opinion formation (by either administrative power or disproportionately empowered private interest).

The formation of small groups with a common interest is an important way of combatting these pressures. If people fear being ostracized from a community or from their means of employment, they are not likely to speak. 

Likewise, when people are only allowed access to certain pieces of information, they are likely to make speech choices from an artificially limited set of options. (These are issues often considered in philosophy under the title "epistemic injustice"). 

Small groups or enclaves help combat these pressures. Thus, Habermas referred to the public sphere as being composed of "small voluntary associations that form nodes in a network." These associations are formed voluntarily, and thus relieved of pressure that might come from compulsory participation or market constraints (e.g. I'll loose my job if I don't join or if I say the wrong thing and get kicked out of the group). But they are also sufficiently small such that no group can significantly pressure the voices of other groups. 

**2. Feeling the effects of deliberation**

In addition to speaking freely, we have also seen that the platform (code) on which free speech acts occur is important. 

In fact, if group formation is not "porous" to the "reverberating effects of deliberation"; that is, if a group makes its members immune to results of dialectic (to the result of two opposing views coming into conflict), then condition number one is threatened. Increasingly, an individual's choice to speak will be constrained because their "opinion formation" has been distorted by lack of access to the results of public deliberation. 

For free speech to result in positive deliberation/dialectic it has to come into open conflict.

I like to think of that conflict producing a kind of reverberation that takes time to be received. Thus, if the speech platform (the technology of communication) hinders the reception of that "reverberation" (if it "clogs the pores" of a deliberative enclave) then speech will actual homogenize. And thus, though there may be quantitatively more speech, there will be qualitatively "less speech". In fact, this combination (high quantity, low quality) may create a distorting amplification of an individual voice (see our discussion "amplification" below.)

It is in this light that I read Sunstein's chapters. In these two chapters, I see Sunstein describing several different ways (along with many examples/studies) that the new modalities (e.g. the speed, scale, cost, discoverability, etc.) of digital media are "clogging pores" of deliberative enclaves, making its members increasingly unable to hear the results of public deliberation, and consequently, constraining the speech of its own members.

With this in mind I would like to focus our discussion around what Sunstein thinks joining a group looks like in the Internet Age and the ways the combination of human behavior and technological possibility prevents reception of the "reverberations" of public deliberation.

# Sunstein, Chapter 3: Polarization

Below I list three ideas that struck me as I ready chapter 3.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Consider pp. 63-68: As technology improves the ability of people to speak, it create the problem of information overload. Given this problem, filtering becomes necessary. 

But as Sunstein notes on p. 64, this is not necessarily a new problem. Filtering was needed and has existed long before the Internet. In fact, as we read, Shapiro identifies a number of defects in the way filtering was previously conducted. Shapiro was excited about the new filtering possibilities of the Internet because it gave individuals more control over the selection process. 

<span class="respond"/> What aspects of the pre-internet filtering process left "open pores" in the deliberative enclave wherein unwanted, unselected content could be received?

<span class="respond"/> According to Sunstein, how is filtering within the Internet closing those "pores"? How is individual "opinion formation" being affected as a result?

</div> 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Sunstein talks a lot about the unique ability of the Internet to enable repetition, and thereby "amplify" a message.

<span class="respond"> What are some examples of this repetition and amplification?

<span class="respond"> How does this amplification distort "public deliberation"? For example, to what extent do **you** consider the reaction of the crowd or the majority of people when you engage in opinion formation? When might it be reasonable or rational to do this? To what extent is the "amplification" effect of the Internet giving people a "distorted" view of the crowd? (Among many pages, consider p. 77, p. 83, p. 85, p. 88.)

</div>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

On p. 75, Sunstein considers the impact of group identity. While group identity can be important (sometimes enabling speech), Sunstein here is attentive to the way group identity leads to a peculiar way of "holding an opinion". Here the issue is not exactly what the opinion is, but why a person holds it and how fiercely a person holds it. 

This seems to have direct effects on how able someone is to "hear and absorb" criticism and receive the results of "deliberative reverberations".

<span class="respond"> In what way is the Internet changing "why" we hold an opinion or how "enthusiastically" we hold that opinion?

<span class="respond"> What are some examples of ways that this kind of "opinion formation" is preventing further deliberation and growth? (Consider especially the sections on pp. 92 and 93.)
</div>


# Sunstein, Chapter 4: Cybercascades

Let's continue with the same kind of reflection with respect to chapter four and the idea of Cybercascades. 

First a few reading questions.

Sunstein notes that researchers have observed that when you have enough people estimating (say the number of jelly beans in the jelly bean jar), the results are usually surprisingly good. (See p. 113)

But this depends on one condition: that members of the crowd are not allowed to consult with one another. When members of the crowd are allowed to consult with one another ahead of time, the results of this crowd estimation are considerably worse. 

{:.rquestion}
How does Sunstein's notion of a cascade help us explain this?

The non-colluding crowd seems like a good example of Habermas's Ideal Speech Situation. Here each person gives their opinion "freely" (without restraint and free of manipulation). The cumulative average (when the extremes have been cancelled out through conflict) of this "crowd" is surprisingly good. But when people are allowed to hear the guesses of others, their own "opinion formation" is distorted and the results our worse. 

{:.rquestion}
What are the two kinds of cascades Sunstein identifies at the opening of this chapter? How do they explain why an individual's opinion formation might irrationally be affected when aware of the guesses of others?

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

As Sunstein notes, to some extent these cascades have always existed. But he suggests that today, the Internet makes them more frequent and more dangerous. 

Let's focus our attention on the example of political petitions (pp. 104-108). Petitions have always existed, but now they exist online.

<span class="respond"/> How is the new "platform" of the petition affecting its success or failure? 

<span class="respond"/> In this form, does a successful petition represent a "rational opinion formation" or is it somehow distorted? If distorted what prevented it from being the result of "deliberation" or "dialectic"? 

<span class="respond"/> Why might a petition with the same number signatures achieved, through physical mail or door to door canvassing, more closely represent the results of dialectical synthesis (i.e. synthesized opinions refined through the opposition of antithesis)? Why might online petitions still represent an un-refined thesis (opinions not yet refined by the dialectical process)?

</div>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

The same dynamic seems to be at work in polling? 

<span class="respond"/> How does the "speed" of polling, enabled by digital communication, affect its results and its subsequent affect on law-givers? 

<span class="respond"/> Why might this speed prevent people's response to a poll from reflecting a "deliberatively informed opinion"?

<span class="respond"/> What is a Fishkin Poll (pp. 133-135) and how does it attempt to address this problem?

</div>

# Note: Does deliberation just mean the "middle"?

Mill, I think, has already shown us that emphasizing the value of deliberation doesn't just mean the rational result is merely the middle. 

Certainly, since we are not infallible, the middle might often be closer to the truth. The example about the astounding accuracy of non-colluding group estimation might be a good example of this. 

But as Mill notes, even if someone is 98% correct, deliberation that exposes someone to another belief that is 98% wrong is still helpful because it may also expose us to the 2% of truth that we are missing. 

And further, if we are 100% correct, the 100% false antithesis still helps us understand the reasons behind our belief and the essential meaning of it.


But sometime the notion of a middle doesn't really make much sense, especially when we move away from probabilities and move toward normative questions, "should" or "should not" statements. Here, the idea that the right thing to do is just halfway between two opposing beliefs doesn't make a lot of sense.

Take for example, opposing positions on immigration. 

Bob says, borders should be open; Sally says, borders should be closed. Is the rational policy merely: borders half open? I think not. What if the issue were civil rights and the opposing positions were, grant civil rights to marginalized communities or do not grant them? Is the rational answers, grant minority communities "half of the civil rights" to marginalized communities? I think not.

Another way we might understand the importance of deliberation and the hearing of many voices (without attempting to "normalize" or "rationalize" manifestly false or even hateful opinions) can be found by looking back to Rousseau. 

Recall, Rousseau's idea of the "General Will" was a "rational will" that each individual possessed but was often hidden by their biased desire for preferential treatment: what he calls, the "Private Will" 

Similarly, for Kant, the categorical imperative represents what I would choose *if I were being rational* and *if I were not being swayed by my instinctual desire for self-preferential treatment*. 

We all struggle with this bias. But it is at the same time possible to identify the rational view as that which *would be chosen* if I could see the world from a "disinterested point of view" (John Rawls calls this the position "behind the veil of ignorance"). This "disinterested point of view" could be considered a kind of middle between complete absorption with my private interest and complete denial of myself and my equal inclusion within society. 

Without context, there is no right answer to open borders closed borders question. This is a value question and the right/rational answer depends on what we value. But our perspective on what is valuable will change as we move from the perspective of the Private Will toward the perspective of the General Will.

It is likely then that the person who wants open borders recognizes some benefits of this policy toward their private interest. Similarly the person who argues for closed borders likely sees benefits to their private interest from this position. 

The goal of dialectic/deliberation then would not be to find a middle between two stated policy positions. Rather, through the clashing of the interests that motivate these policy positions, each party would be more capable of seeing the competing interests of the other. Through this clash, we are encouraged to consider the situation again from a more neutral perspective.In this way, deliberation would help us acquire the perspective of the General Will. And then finally, the policy position that results from this perspective would be considered the rational proposal.

**But I think there is one caveat here**. The Internet's ability to repeat or amplifying an individual voice could still have a distorting effect. An amplified voice creates the impression of more competing interests than there actually are. In an attempt to arrive at the perspective of the General Will (which takes into account all competing interest), this perspective will be distorted by the artificial impression of voices and interests that do not actually exist.

Here, following Mill, we might readily allow hateful and prejudiced voices to enter the public sphere, as these are voices that represents the interest of real people within society. Thus these persons interests/opinions must be taken into account as one attempts to acquire the perspective of the General Will. 

And yet at the same time, the amplification and repetition of these voices in echo chambers or by "bots" might need to be curtailed, since this amplification suggests that there are more persons standing behind these voices than there actually are.



<!-- # Problem

One problem we face here is -- seen especially in the examples where the internet seems to advance extremism (see the podcast on youtube and radicalization) -- is to simultaneously recognize the importance of protecting freedom of speech for the benefits of preserving the possibility of discourse and debate and the same time justifying the restraint on freedom of speech in a certain cases. 

The problem is clearly illustrated for us if we follow the trajectory from Habermas to Shapiro to the rise of the alt-right. 

On the one hand, we have the Habermas like complaint about neo-feudalism aimed at the rise of media conglomerates. 

Here it seems like we need more diversity. Here it seems like freedom of speech is not be sufficiently protected. 

In this vain, we have the champions of the early internet like Shapiro welcoming the Internet as vehicle to usher in a new era of the public sphere. 

Youtube is certainly seen as such, allowing each person to be a broadcaster with the ability to say almost anything. 

This, as we have seen has bothered people to the point that there seems to be too much diversity. 

And the subsequent attempts by youtube to begin controlling content have been met by the very same "habermas" like critiques, google and the media conglomerates are trying to control speech, rather than allow the public form to exist. 

And here there is some trouble. 

How do justify the restriction of free speech without being hypocritical, without undermining the critique voiced by Habermas in the 20th century?

An approach that justifies restrictions based solely the whether one likes the outcome or not is problematic because any critique becomes circular. Speech should be free as long it says what a like to here, but it says something I don't like it should be regulated / censured because it is leading people to radicalizing. 

The circularity of this approach is evident in the fact that that left and right use the exact same rhetoric again one another, each claiming the other to be radical and of undue influence.

# Resolution 

Escaping from this circle might benefit a closer look at freedom speech and its goals, and then examining how different media types contribute to these goals, in turn justifying different forms of regulation that correspond to the unique features of each media. 

Lessig discussing a parallel topic, namely "property rights" write: 

>"But even with ordinary property--your car, or your house--property rights are never absolute. There is not property that does not have to yield at some point to the interest of the estate" (pg. 181)

>"...In countless wasy, the system of property we call "private property" is a system that balances exclusive control by individual against certain common state ends. When the latter conflict with the former, it is the former that yeilds." (p. 181)

Could something similar be said about the "right to free speech". Certainly, the first amendment would appear to raise the stakes a bit, suggesting that the value placed on the good of free speech is higher than the value of private property. But all this means is that balance is heavier in the favor of speech over the achievement of state ends than is in the case of the private properties. But it does not change the fundamental fact that the right to free speech is not absolute and thus its limits are bounded by the interest of the state, or rather the public good. 

Citizens do not have the right to scream "fire" in a crowded theater. Citizens do not have the right to scream through a bull horn through the neighborhood at 3am in the morning. 

But if the right to free speech is not absolute, there are must be values or principles that guide its demarcation, even if those values have remained implicit. 

This value as we've discussed has not always been clear or disambiguated. As we've seen in the case of Holmes and Brandeis, there is more than one value that could justify the protection of free speech. 

Holmes (consumer sovereignty) and Brandeis ( responsibility for public debate).

The reason we could consider this a latent ambiguity is because the nature of the dominant media forms of the 20th century carried with them certain features and limitations that never really forced us to decide which of these values/principles was driving the downstream effect of protecting free speech in general. 

In a world, where public broadcast was limited by the high cost of access to a limited set of bandwidths, the idea that there would be too many voices to many voices reach too many people was not a real imaginable concern.

On the contrary, all the risks were in the other direction. The constraints of media type were already doing a good job of limiting the amplification of individual opinions. The danger lie entirely in the other direction. The costs and limits of the media required us to be vigilant to protect speech of those without access to power of mass publication.

And in this the regard the desire to protect consumer choice and the desire to promote an open public discussion co-align never requiring to us to clear define which value was the principle driver.

For most of us, it seems obvious that to promote a fruitful public discussion, to allow the dynamics of dialectic to work, a diversity of opinion is required.

But it is likely much less obvious that too much diversity of opinion could harm the process of dialectic, precisely because, given the forms of media at our disposable, this was hardly conceivable. 

And it as this point the consequences of the Holmes and Brandeis positions start to have diverging effects forcing us to choose one over the other for the first time.

The power of the internet makes it possible for everyone to be a broadcaster and everyone to reach everyone. 

The argument driven my the value of consumer choices would force us to see this as a trend to be allowed with limitation. The greater the diversity of opinion the greater the power of consumer of choice, the more this value is promoted and protected.

But if the goal is is not to allow consumers to have whatever they want, but to create a space for public debate so that a refined truth might emerge through the process of dialectic, there may actually be a limit to the value of diversity both to the sheer number of opinions and to the range of those opinions.

The Brandeis position creates difficulties that the Holmes / Consumer choice opinion does force upon us. 

The boundaries set by the consumer choice position are much broader. Free speech would seem limited only by speech that in turns limits successive future free speech, or perhaps limits the equal enjoyment of the right to free speech. 

Thus on this view we could limit someone's ability to scream "fire" in a theater because this prevents the speech of the film maker, and the ability of others to watch the film. It also threatens the lives of everyone in the theater (as it likely causes a panic driven stampeded) thus threaten to reduce the amount of future consumer choice among all theater patrons. 

But the Brandeis position is more difficult as it would seem to justify more restrictions on the basis of more than just physical safety, but whether or not speech is contributing to the overall goal of creating more and more educated citizens and a more enlightened populations.

But the problem is further exacerbated by the fact that an individual's particular belief about whether or not particular speech is true or not cannot be the measure of this boundary because this leads to a circle. 

The whole point of allowing free speech from the Brandeis position is to create a kind of "agonistic" arena where beliefs can battle and the truth can emerge. To judge which opinions can and cannot enter the arena based on prior knowledge of what the truth is, is to assume the conclusion from the outset. 

The problem is that that the Brandeis (and Public Forum Doctrine) position exists on the assumption that no one individually has access to perfect knowledge, and it is only through the refinement of beliefs against the beliefs of others that we can get closer to truth. 

# Help from Virtue Epistemology

But it is perhaps here that something like Virtue Epistemology might be helpful. We might not be able to decide a priori which beliefs can enter the arena of public debate based on whether or not that specific belief conforms to a specific truth. But we maybe be able to create general classifications of beliefs that can be show to be helpful to the goals of public debate and the pursuit of truth. 

Thus without judging the specific content of any belief beforehand, we can nevertheless define beforehand parameters that determine whether such an opinion contributes to the goals of public debate or not.

In may be helpful here to imagine a trial court. The goal of such court is justice. Such a trial takes place precisely human history has observed that identify what is and what is not just is difficult, and no one individual has a God's eye perspective on the truth. The trial court presumes that none of us may ever see the truth with perfect clarity, a trial offers us the possibility of a refining discourse that may allow us to come closer. 

And of course a trial is defined, if by nothing else, than by rules determining the kinds of information that can be introduced, the kinds of witnesses that can be introduced, and the kinds of arguments can be made. Why are these rules allowed? Precisely because there is a recognition that while it is really helpful to the cause of truth to allow a diversity of few points to be considered, it doesn't follow that an unlimited range of opinion is also helpful. In fact, wild speculation and unfounded conjecture have been shown to be helpful and restricted on these grounds.

So, even while allowing a great deal more latitude in freedom of expression than is allowed in a court room, society might still be justified in limiting speech even when there is consumer demand for such speech. To avoid circular reasoning, such limitations would have to be based upon general criteria and never (or rarely) on the content of a specific claim. 

But virtue epistemology might be able to help with the development of such classifications. Patterns of excellent thinking have attributes x, y, and z, therefore claims made without these attributes or conditions could be limited. Or patterns of excellent thinking might lack attribute A, therefore claims having attribute A should not be admitted. 

Further like a courtroom, limitations might take into account scope as well as content. While it may important for a fringe opinion to be made known, if only make it clear that such a position has been taken seriously and is need of response, the resonating power of the new media has shown that allowing such a belief to echo at scale is counter productive to the reason for its origin admission. Thus limitation might similar be justified. 


# The Gettier Problem. 

Perhaps the most difficult thing about implementing such a procedure would be discipline required to resist the seductive power and scale of the media when it seems to work in one's favor. 

Does a good end justify a bad means. In the short term, it often seems so. But in the long term, the collateral damage of such a decision is a weakened public sphere and weakened ability of the public sphere to englighten the public at large.

On this point the Gettier Problem and the critiera of knowledge is helpful reminder of why the means/route to true belief is important. Simple correct belief is not sufficient. 

Therefore, virtuous knowledge, as the ideal of the public forum, would therefore justify the limitation of free expression that would in the near term appear beneficial, but ultimately long term. A short cut route to correct belief through the introduction of claims that do not meet the general criteria of inclusion would lead to correct belief but not virtuous knowledge. As such it would weaken the integrity of the public forum and produce belief states that are fragile and prone to future manipulation. 

The Gettier problem is described as follows:

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-virtue/
>"A related benefit of the basic approach is that, in the eyes of many practitioners, it solves the Gettier problem. Gettier cases follow a recipe. Start with a belief sufficiently justified to meet the justification condition for knowledge. Then add an element of bad luck that would normally prevent the justified belief from being true. Lastly add a dose of good luck that “cancels out the bad”, so the belief ends up true anyhow. It has proven difficult to explain why this “double luck” prevents knowledge (Zagzebski 1996)."

>"Here is a Gettier case (adapted from Zagzebski 1996: 285–6). Mary enters the house and looks into the living room. A familiar appearance greets her from her husband’s chair. She thinks, “My husband is sitting in the living room”, and then walks into the den. But Mary misidentified the man in the chair. It is not her husband, but his brother, whom she had no reason to believe was even in the country. However, her husband was seated along the opposite wall of the living room, out of Mary’s sight, dozing in a different chair."

>"The VE solution to the Gettier problem is that knowledge requires you to believe the truth “because of” your intellectual virtues, but Gettier subjects do not believe the truth because of their virtues, so they do not know (Zagzebski 1996: 285 ff; Greco 2003; Sosa 2007: ch. 5; Turri 2011). Some critics complain that this view is uninformative because we lack an adequate understanding of what it is to believe “because of” or “out of” virtue (e.g., Roberts & Wood 2007). Other critics argue that the basic approach still suffers from counterexamples (e.g., Baehr 2006a; Church 2013)."

The Gettier problem might show why we might criticize some media forms even if they lead to conclusion we like and address a tension (or uneasiness) in the story of Caleb (in the youtube podcast) the manner in which he seems to escape from the extremism of the right.

[references/quotes from podcast here]

For example: As Sunstein suggestion (quote on page 65), the scale of connectivity of the internet may lead marginal opinions to build because they are re-enforced by others who re-affirm these opinions and passions which "stoke" or "enflame" these opinions. 

But at first you might say, this doesn't seem necessarily bad. In fact, this kind of connectivity might seem good because the reinforcement pushes people to join the group, pursuing a cause that you see as good. 

But what happens if this same approach influence leads to radicalization toward positions we do not like. 

In this case, there appears to be little room to criticize the medium. 

The attempt to criticize it only when it leads to conclusions you don't like is problematic because it the critique is circular. The medium leads me toward a particular idea of correct belief, and then that medium is judged to good or bad based on the very belief it led me to believe.


Oddly, it seems that critiquing the medium here as the vehicle that leads to a problematic belief would force us to also the critique that led him away from it. And conversely, praising the medium that led to a better belief would force us to praise the very same medium that led him to the problematic belief. 

The VE solution to the Gettier problem might help us here. We might be able to approve of Caleb's new belief without yet calling it knowledge, because it is not yet believed on the grounds of intellectual virtue, but still on the grounds of the majority/mob or rhetorical points, or as he sometimes says "owning" an opponent in argument. In this regard, I would consider Caleb's new belief very fragile, unstable, and vulnerable to the next persuasion. -->
