# Review

With today's reading, our goal is to continue looking at the foundational arguments used to support the equation that "more speech equals better deliberation". 

As we discussed last time, champions of deliberative democracy have long argued that freedom of expression is critical to the goals of a deliberative (rather than a direct) democracy. We began to see this in Kant's *What is Enlightenment*. Today we to look closer at this argument in what is perhaps the most famous defense of freedom of expression, John Stuart Mill's, *On Liberty*, Chapter 2, "on liberty of thought and discussion". From there we want to look at an equally famous contemporary philosopher Jürgen Habermas (who relies heavily on the thought of Friedrich Fröbel) who points to some of the reasons why a "public sphere" is necessary for "deliberation" and some of the political challenges in creating that "public sphere".

**NOTE: The majority of our class time will focus on the reading from Mill, so please focus your attention there first; with the time remaining, we will try to pull out a few key details from the Habermas reading.**

As always, we want to think about how the desired effects of free speech (identified by Mill and Habermas) are dependent on more than just the written law, but also on the logic of the platform, architecture, or code that makes speech possible. Within these architectures, speech will happen in certain ways, at certain speeds, with certain costs. 

Thus in the background, we need to constantly be asking whether or not the desired effects of free speech persists when the underlying assumptions about the platform of speech have changed. 

Sunstein (as we will see) does not always think these effects will remain when the platform has changed, and thus the equation, "more speech equals better deliberation" does not always remain true in our new media landscape. This is of course getting ahead of things. But it is important to keep it in mind, as this is where we are headed.

# Mill, On liberty, c. 2

The argument of chapter 2 has tight structure, but Mill's 19th century writing and the lack of visual cues sometimes makes it difficult to follow. 

However, Mill's conclusion offers us some clues. 

> "We have now recognised the necessity to the mental well-being of mankind (on which all their other well-being depends) of freedom of opinion, and freedom of the expression of opinion, on four distinct grounds; which we will now briefly recapitulate." <span class="citation" data-reading="SWWUUQXZ=>c. 2" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/rgRJ0idZEeuQ1Q-kowQbHA/www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm"/>

These four arguments revolve around Mill's response to a central objection: if we know the truth, why should we, a society, allow it to be contradicted by error. 

I'd like to discuss each of these arguments in turn.

As Mill states at the outset, his response follows two main paths: 

> "It is necessary to consider separately these two hypotheses, each of which has a distinct branch of the argument corresponding to it. We can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a false opinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still." <span class="citation" data-reading="SWWUUQXZ=>c. 2" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/fWNSyidNEeu6ssPhHKjMUw/www.gutenberg.org/files/34901/34901-h/34901-h.htm"/>


<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

First, he says we need to question the assumption that, since we as a society know the truth, therefore we do not need to hear these presumably false opinions.

Be prepared to provide an account of this argument.

<span class="respond"/> What is the basic argument here?

<span class="respond"/> What do you think about this argument? How far should this argument be stretched? Are there some truths so certain or useful, or are there some truths so false or dangerous, that it does not seem inappropriate to outlaw the expression of these falsehoods?

</div>

The argument then moves forward, by assuming the premise disputed in his first response. Let's assume, he says, that society does actually have access to the truth. Are there still important reasons that a society might want to allow erroneous beliefs to be heard?

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Noted as "second" in his final recapitulation but actually discussed last in his chapter (starting around p. 84), Mill notes that even if the received opinion (the dominant social belief) is "mostly true" and if the opinion is "mostly false", there it still has some important part of the truth that the "mostly false" opinion can deliver.

<span class="respond"/> What is the basic argument here?

<span class="respond"/> What examples does he give to support this argument?

<span class="respond"/> What do you think about this argument? Is it strong? Why? Are there exceptions? Why?

</div>

But then he pushes the issue even further. Let's assume (for the sake of argument) that a society's beliefs were, *per impossibile*, known to be infallibly and completely true. In this case why should we not then censor opposing positions, which we know, again *per impossibile*, to be completely false.

Mill offers two arguments in this regard, arguments 3 and 4 respectively in his final recapitulation.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> What is the third argument? (Hint: it has something to do with understanding the "reason" or "ground" of an opinion.) (See around p. 64.)

Again, we're looking to test his argument. So...

<span class="respond"/> Does the argument presume anything about the "platform" of speech? (Such that the argument might not follow if the "platform" where changed?)

<span class="respond"/> Are there any exceptions or extremes where his position about falsehoods improving our understanding of the truth would not follow?

</div>

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"/> What is the fourth argument? (Hint: it has something to do with understanding the "meaning" of an opinion.) (See around p. 72.)

<span class="respond"/> Why is this important? 

<span class="respond"/> What examples does he give?

Again, we're looking to test his argument. So...

<span class="respond"/> Does the argument presume anything about the "platform" of speech? (Such that the argument might not follow if the "platform" where changed?)

<span class="respond"/> Are there any exceptions or extremes where his position about falsehoods improving our understanding of the truth would not follow.
</div>

<!-- ## Arguments for 1. 

We are not infallibile. 

Objection, just because we are not infallible, doesn't mean we should use our best judgment to root out what is false or dangerous to the well being of society.

Why does Mill think English social intolerance might be worse that the outright hostility toward Socrates and the Christians (see p. 59)

Threat of persecution for speech teaches others to be anxious and nervous about using their own reason, thus their "mental development is cramped" (p. 61) --  perhaps the effect of "cancel culture"??)

A few great thinkers might still emerge in such an environment, but there will never be an "intellectually" active people in such an environment.

## Arguments for 2. 

Assume for the sake of argument that a societies beliefs were, per impossibile, known to be infallibile true; why should we not then censor opposing positions, which we know, again per impossibile, to be false.

difference between true opinion (knowing that it is true) and knowledge (knowing why it is true)

Even if we try to suppress opposition, some discussion will sneak in. 

And if people don't know why they believe something, they are likely to be easily swayed by a false counter opinion.

Objection around p. 70

Mill Raises new concern on p. 72 

Not only "the grounds" for an opinion might remain unknown, but also the opinion itself might be lost or confused.

The belief is no longer living. (in ability to "translate", the essence of what is said is lost, or confused with the inessential)

What's the difference between dead and living beliefs? ("dead beliefs" p. 75)

New objection on p. 80. 

"If everyone agrees, will it no longer be possible to know the truth?"

Transition, p. 84/85

## Third option

What happens when both conflicting opinions share the truth between them

concluding section around 97/98

Four reasons for free expression restated: 

2) if it is mostly false, it may contain some truth that comes out through collision (in body text this seems introduced after 3 and 4)

if it is completely false, but not heard 

3 then we will not know the "reasons" for the truth

4 or we will not understand its meaning

Final objection, the manner in which a opinion is introduced into discussion must be "temperate"

What counts as temperate? -->


# Habermas and the Public Sphere

(Note: I'm still working on developing my notes for this section :))

The concept of the Public Sphere is an idea that today is closely associated with the name Habermas.

In this, admittedly very difficult article, I hope we get a sense of 1) what he means by Public Sphere, 2) why this is needed in addition to the official deliberating bodies (such as the "Senate" as conceived by the Founding Fathers, 3) and a sense of what he thinks it takes to maintain this kind of Public Sphere.

My focus here then is primarily on section 4 (pp. 55-63). But let's just note a few preliminary things. 

Habermas walks us through a political history already somewhat familiar to us. Rousseau is key player in this story, as Rousseau did not want to accept the dichotomy between "liberty" over "equality" and wanted to find arrangement in which everyone liberty and peace were protected but at the same time everyone remained autonomous and thereby equal.

But Rousseau's theoretical ideas were difficult to realize, and critiques rightly worried that the "will of the people" would inevitably become the tyranny of the majority or even tyranny of the most politically active or the loudest shouters.

In section 2.2, p. 46, Habermas points to both Mill and Fröbel as examples of thinkers who argued that since, the majority obviously cannot represent the General Will (the "will of the people"), it must emerge through the established procedures of deliberation; voting and subsequent discussion. 

Here, Habermas is really calling our attention to the Fröbel and Mill's preference for a deliberative democracy over direct democracy, which echoes the intention of the founder of the American constitution when they created the Senate as a kind of cooling force against the passionate voice of the "mob". 

What follows in section two and three is an elaborate defense of the need for "deliberation" and "open discussion", along the lines of what we have seen in Mill. 

In section 4, Habermas tries to take us one step further.

In section 4, Habermas recaps how deliberative bodies function as a check on executive power.

He writes: 

> "Normative  reasons, which justify adopted policies and enacted norms in the language of law, are regarded in the language of administrative power as  rationalizations  appended  to  decisions  that  were  previously  induced." (p. 56)

In other words, executive/administrative powers, in being responsible for action, are required to rationalize those actions. Deliberative bodies constrain executive action by constraining the pool of normative reasons that can be appealed to in order to justify action. 

Again he writes:

> "Communicatively  generated  legitimate  power  can have an effect on the political system insofar as it assumes responsibility  for  the  pool  of  reasons  from  which  administrative  decisions must  draw  their  rationalizations.  If  the  normative  arguments  appended by the system have been discursively invalidated by counter-arguments from prior political communication, then it is simply not the case that “anything goes,” that is, anything feasible for the political system." (p. 56)

I illustrate this below as follows: 

![picture](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/pl399/HabermasPublicSphereFigures/Folie1.jpeg)

But Habermas notes next, there is a danger here of manipulation. The executive/administrative branch can extend its power by manipulate the process of deliberation and subsequently affecting the "normative reasons" it has at its disposal to justify its actions. (Consider how propaganda is used by a government to manufacture justifications for its actions.)

The "elitist" answer (as Habermas calls it on p. 57) to this problem is to develop institutionalized deliberating bodies (like the Senate or Parliament) to prevent the manipulation of the masses by those that wield executive power.

{:.rquestion}
But what problem does Habermas believe he has found at this point (p. 57)? Why has Fröbel overlooked something?

> "if the voters’ opinion is irrational,  then  the  election  of  representatives  is  no  less  so." <span class="citation" data-reading="GCYCSLUR=>p. 57" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/6iwmDCeTEeutliOzsnurzw/s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/pl399/Habermas_1997_Popular_Sovereignty_as_Procedure.pdf">

To resolve this dilemma, Habermas thinks we need to pay attention to something new: namely the relationship between "political will-formation" and the "surrounding environment of unstructured processes of opinion-formation".

Here he argues that in addition to organized deliberative bodies that are responsible for reaching decisions, unofficial, spontaneous, "unsubverted circuits of communication in the public sphere" that are not required to make decisions are needed. 

He describes these as:

>Voluntary associations represent the nodal  points  in  a  communication  network  that  emerges  from  the intermeshing of autonomous public spheres. <span class="citation" data-reading="GCYCSLUR=>p. 57" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/wYFpDOCdEeqj0H-9Z8wVlg/s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/pl399/Habermas_1997_Popular_Sovereignty_as_Procedure.pdf">

This might look something like the following: 

![picture](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/pl399/HabermasPublicSphereFigures/Folie2.jpeg)

Evidence of the power of the power of the voluntary associations, he suggests, can be seen in the correlation between voting behavior the general mood of political culture.

This un-official political culture is required in order for official deliberating bodies to do their work. 

> "Naturally, even a proceduralized “popular sovereignty” of this sort cannot operate without the support of an accommodating political culture,  without  the  basic  attitudes,  mediated  by  tradition  and  socialization, of a population accustomed to political freedom: rational political will-formation cannot occur unless a rationalized life-world meets it halfway." <span class="citation" data-reading="GCYCSLUR=>p. 59" data-annotation="https://hyp.is/QH1GPieVEeuVtS89Lw1beQ/s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/pl399/Habermas_1997_Popular_Sovereignty_as_Procedure.pdf">

In sum: According to Habermas, then critical to the health of a democracy is the health of the "public sphere". This network of voluntary associations is what ensure the independence of the official deliberating bodies, which in turn ensures that executive power is controlled by the sovereignty of the rational will of the people.

Final note: Difficult to grasp, but I think important, is the idea that public sphere "reproduces itself self-referentially" (p. 58). (Consider also the [difficult paragraph at the bottom of p. 58 and extending to page 59](https://hyp.is/o-TXyCefEeu_PmNCZ_Y1-g/s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/pl399/Habermas_1997_Popular_Sovereignty_as_Procedure.pdf)) Here I imagine that he means that the debating public, in their freedom to communicate opinions and beliefs is, at the same that they are debating and arguing -- is generating something shared; a shared consciousness of their participation in the public sphere and its generative power of the "General Will". 

This seems important in relation to the thesis of Sunstein. Here the act of communication -- even if what is communicated is in conflict -- generates something common and collective. This also reminds one of McLuhan's thesis that the "medium" is much more important than the "message". The "message" may be one of disagreement, its communication generates a sense of something "common". We should be attentive then to the communications platforms/architectures that allow this collective self-consciousness to emerge, and perhaps worry with Sunstein if a form of communication becomes possible where this salutary side-effect is not produced.

With this in mind, let's engage in a little bit of reflection together.

<div class="discussion">

<span class="respond"> First, can we identify some examples of the kind of unorganized "voluntary associations" Habermas has in mind?

<span class="respond"> How do we know when these associations are healthy and performing the function Habermas has in mind?

<span class="respond"> What might this associations look like in a pre-digital world? How would they communicate? Does the communications platform enable or disable the kind of social function Habermas expects from these groups?

<span class="respond"> Would AOL chatrooms, MMOGs, USENET, or facebook groups today count as such associations? Why or why not? How might they be similar or different from such groups in a pre-digital world?

<!-- Let's focus on just a few key moments through some "Guided Reading Questions".

{:.rquestion}
What tension exists between liberty and equality? 

{:.rquestion}
Why aren't the these the same?

{:.rquestion}
Why does Locke privilege liberty over equality? What is he afraid of?

{:.rquestion}
How does Rousseau attempt to overcome this concern by distinguishing between the private will and real will of individuals? 

{:.question}
What difficulty does Rousseau's solution face? (We've looked at this difficulty once before.)

{:.answer}
Its unclear how one actually finds the General Will. In this case, how is it possible for the General Will to avoid simply becoming the tyranny of the majority?

{:.question}
How does Fröbel attempt to overcome this difficulty? (See pp. 46-48)

<div class="answer" markdown="1">

Fröbel attempts to identify the conditions and nature of **the procedure**. The outcome of which one can be confident that the general will has been achieved (or approximated) as opposed to simply achieving a majority self-interested view which thus tramples and suppresses liberty.

Fröbel's answer here seems similar to Kant's. Rather identify what the right answer is, he describes a "procedure" ("free use of public reason") whose outcome, whatever it is, will represent the command of the General Will, or "Rationality".

</div>

Habermas adds to Fröbel's view, saying: 

> "This dilemma turns our attention toward a relation Fröbel did not discuss, that  between  formally structured political will formation and the surrounding environment of unstructured processes of opinion formation." <span class="citation" data-reading="GCYCSLUR=>p. 57"/>

Habermas suggests that discursive will-formation requires certain **environmental** conditions to which Fröbel did not give sufficient attention.

{:.rquestion}
What kinds of conditions does Habermas have in mind? What kinds of conditions are necessary in order for speech to translate into deliberation?

This seems central to our discussion of the role of the medium or "platform" in determining whether or not "more speech equals better deliberation". 

{:.rquestion}
If this equation requires certain conditions to be met, what role does the available communications medium play in achieving those conditions? 

{:.rquestion} 
To what extent is a government justified in enacting laws or restricting freedom in order to acquire these conditions. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

If the code or platform no longer protects these environmental conditions (think about the "logic" of a newspaper and how forces one to encounter other perhaps unwanted articles)... 

<span class="respond"/>...to what extent is the government justified in ensuring these environmental conditions through written laws?

<span class="respond"/> Wouldn't this be a restriction of consumer sovereignty? On what basis would government "by the people" be justified in restricting "consumer sovereignty"?
</div>

Undoubtedly "creation of environmental conditions" raises difficult political questions.

Creating these conditions seems to require external regulation and perhaps even force.

In the Rousseauian manner, it might be possible to justify this force if it were the will of the people. 

But this is difficult, because in this case, we are talking about the conditions necessary for deliberation to take place so that the true "will of the people" can emerge. 

How can the will of the people be invoked to justify the protection of the conditions for deliberation, since by definition these conditions would be enforced prior to deliberation and prior to the determination of the will of the people.

The advantage of conditions enforced through the existing communications code was that the limitations on consumer sovereignty never seemed enforced by political will but mere by merely by the limitations of nature. 

Now that "nature" no longer protects these conditions, successful deliberation demands conditions that it is hard for deliberation itself to justify.

Habermas writes:

> "Naturally, even a proceduralized “popular sovereignty” of this sort cannot operate without the support of an accommodating political culture,  without  the  basic  attitudes,  mediated  by  tradition  and  socialization, of a population accustomed to political freedom: rational political will-formation cannot occur unless a rationalized life world meets it halfway. This thesis could appear to be just one more guise for a civic-republican ethos and its expectations of virtue that have morally overburdened citizens since time immemorial." <span class="citation" data-reading="GCYCSLUR=>p. 59"/>

Habermas here seems to rely on or trust that there must be sufficient rationality or civic virtue within the people themselves (prior to deliberation) to recognize the "rationality" of enforcing these conditions prior to deliberation itself.

In this way, he would expect individuals to recognize that goverment intervention is justified *a priori*, in anticipation of the will of the people. Conditions would then be imposed that, while not yet chosen by the people, theoretically *would be chosen* if the condition were in place for healthy will formation to develop. -->
