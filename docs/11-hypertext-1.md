# Review 

Last class we focused on the frustrations that digital pioneers were having with the print medium. 

In general we tried to look at ways that the medium was limiting or constraining the way we experienced a text. 

Speaking generally, we focused on three main features:

* access immediacy, selection, and curation (Bush)
* interconnectivity (Bush and Nelson)
* non-linearity or multi-sequence (Neslon)

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
As part of our review let me pose an opening discussion question.

In Bush, Nelson, and today in Landow, each thinker in their own way has been emphasizing how critical it is to be able to treat a text as a container of smaller independent units. These units have been referred to variously as chunks, atoms, granular units, or even "lexia". No matter the name, these small units have been treated as critical to the possibility of experiencing a text as multi-sequenced rather than as confined to a single sequence. 

<span class="respond"> My question is, why is this ability to treat the text as composed of progressively smaller text units so important? Or conversely, if we could only "address" the large top level text container, why might this prevent our ability to experience a text as multi-sequenced?
</div>

Today I'd like to continue this discussion of the limiting effects of the print medium by looking at few more articles from another group of thinkers with a different background. Not only did the printed text feel constraining to computer and internet pioneers, but it also felt limiting to a group of thinkers often referred to as "post-structuralists", which includes thinkers like Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and Roland Barthes.

Landow's book **Hypertext** is informed by the concerns of these thinkers and his excitement about the new affordances of the digital medium. We will look at two of his chapters focused on reading and writing respectively, and, during our consideration of hypertext writing, look at two essays by Barthes and Foucault on the nature of authorship.

# Hypertext reading

At the outset it would be good for us to simply clarify what Landow has in mind by a "hypertext", how it differs from a non-hypertext, and why he thinks this is a positive technological innovation.

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">
After reading Landow's account of several examples and types of hypertext...

<span class="respond">...what seems like a good definition of a "hypertext"? How might this differ from a mere "digitized book"? (See the bottom of pg. 70 where he begins to make some subtle comparisons of what are mostly "digitized" books to more robust hypertext projects.)

<span class="respond"> Why do you think Landow is a "fan" of hypertexts? 

<span class="respond"> What new possibilities does he see and why does he see these possibilities as a positive? What criteria does he use, explicitly or implicitly to evaluate hypertext as a positive or beneficial technology? (If you can find some criteria, this might be useful to our project of collecting ideas for an "edition-rubric". So make sure to mark your annotation with the tag "edition-rubric")

With respect to this last question, consider the section beginning on p. 71 that states: 

> "Before considering other kinds of hypertext, we should note the implicit justifications or rationales for these two successful projects" (P. 71)

<!-- For example, what does he say about the role of "granularity" (p. 71) and "atomization" (see p. 74-75) in hypertext? How are these at work in the examples he describes? Why are these positive? How does this relate to Nelson's idea of "text chunks"?  -->

</div>

Finally, Landow again seems to note how our language is inherited from our familiarity with a previous medium. But just like the word "send" was changed by the telegraph, so words like "book" and "text" require a new meaning. But at the same time, old words and old meanings threaten (through "paradigmatic regression") to limit our imagination of a possible future.

In the section beginning on p. 82, Landow discusses how the terms "read, write, and text" as so heavily infused with the paradigm of the print medium that using them in a hypertext environment inevitably distorts their meaning and creates ambiguity.

He writes: 

> "Terms so implicated with print technology necessarily confuse unless handled with great care." (See p. 82)

Let's briefly consider the two examples he gives. 

## Example 1: What is Book?

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Landow gives a first example about the word "book" on pp. 82 and 83.

<span class="respond"> Why does Landow think the word "book" is a problematic way of identifying "what one reads"?

<span class="respond"> Specifically, how does the word "book" obfuscate or hide many of things we do (or can do) when we read a "hypertext"?
</div>

## Example 2: What is a Text?

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Landow gives a second example about the word "text" on pp. 83 and 84.

<span class="respond"> Why does Landow think the word "text" is a problematic way of identifying "what one reads"? How has the world of print determined the meaning of this word in specific ways? How might this understanding of the word "text" limit our understanding of a "hyperlinked text"?

</div>

# Hypertext writing

Let's turn now to a consideration of writing in the age of hypertext. First let's begin with a discussion of the "primary source" articles by Barthes and Foucault. Here I have a few questions for each article.

## Barthes

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

<span class="respond"> Why is Barthes concerned with the idea of an "author"? What does he think the "author" is (or should) be dead? 

<span class="respond"> If you had to summarize this article in one sentence, how would you describe Barthes' central message or thesis?

(Note that I've added several question annotations to the text itself; please consider these questions as you read.)
</div>

## Foucault 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

Foucault describes four different characteristics of the "author function". See his summary on p. 153.
<!-- seep. 150, characteristic 3 
how does St. Jerome construct the "author"?
Summary on p. 153
-->
<!-- How many different ways can we speak of an author? How does the printed medium (constrain our recognition of these author types or prompt us to singular or  simplistic views of the author) -->
<!-- what are authors of "discursivity"; how might these "authors" get lost within the writing o another "author" -->


<span class="respond"> Why does Foucault think it is important to identify these different author functions (See especially, Foucault's conclusion on p. 157)? How might it change our approach to the study or investigation of literature?

<span class="respond"> With this new research goal in mind, how might different media aid in this study? Does the printed text push us to see one kind of relationship between author and text (e.g. "author" as independent "genius" creating a new product)? Might a hypertext medium allow us to see a more complicated, participatory productive process and help us see the author as a social construction that emerges only after the text is realized? How so?
</div>

### Example 1

Let me try to offer one concrete example of where I think Barthes' and Foucault's idea -- that  the "author" is more than a mere writer, but also a form of privilege, power, and control -- has constrained social imagination and prevented the realization of genuine possibilities. Further, in this example, we can see how the notion of a hypertext and collaborative composition -- where the "author" get lost or fades to the background -- is a large part of what finally allowed this possibility to be realized. 

The example I have in mind is Wikipedia. The article, [*The Hive*](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/09/the-hive/305118/) in the Atlantic relates the story of Wikipedia's surprising success. 

As the story goes, Wikipedia's creation and success was an accident. The original goal was to build *Nupedia*, an online encyclopedia. But Nupedia was conceived along the lines of a paper encyclopedia, where the limits of the medium made collaborative composition difficult and likewise make the idea iterative updates and revisions impossible. 

Thus the original vision expected that articles would be assigned to *Authosr* --- single individuals with "credentialed" names that would function as a source of social authority for the article. (Consider: Why I should trust this article? Because it was written by this *Author* not just any "writer").

The articles states:

> "There was simply no question in his mind that Nupedia would be guided by a board of experts, that submissions would be largely written by experts, and that articles would be published only after extensive peer review. Sanger set about recruiting academics to work on Nupedia."

But as the article relates, Nupedia failed. 

> "Then there was the real problem: production. Sanger and the Nupedia board had worked out a multistage editorial system that could have been borrowed from any scholarly journal. In a sense, it worked: assignments were made, articles were submitted and evaluated, and copyediting was done. But, to both Wales and Sanger, it was all much too slow."

{:rquestion} 
Why do you think it was so slow? How might the ideas of power and authority that we associate with the "author function" be slowing down the work of contributors and the peer-review process? 

{:rquestion}
Similarly, why the might the inability to think of the text as a container for a series of smaller text chunks have prevented collaboration and slowed the process?

Wikipedia was then invented "on the side", original intended to be "quick" (Wiki being the Hawaiian word for "quick") entries that could help speed up the progress of Nupedia. But why was it so quick? How did the idea of "text chunks" connected via hyperlink and the "death of the author" contribute to this quickness? 

Because individual contributions could be linked together, anyone could contribute any amount. Authorship became collaborative, effectively destroying the associations of power, authority, and prestige that are normally associated with the "author". 

And stripped of these "author functions", people felt free to make contributions quickly, in small (connectable) chunks, and without the unrealizable expectations that society expects of the "author genius".

As the article notes, the speed and scale with which Wikipedia outpaced Nupedia was astonishing. 

> The initial purpose was to get the public to add entries that would then be “fed into the Nupedia process” of authorization. Most of Nupedia’s expert volunteers, however, wanted nothing to do with this, so Sanger decided to launch a separate site called “Wikipedia.” Neither Sanger nor Wales looked on Wikipedia as anything more than a lark. This is evident in Sanger’s flip announcement of Wikipedia to the Nupedia discussion list. “Humor me,” he wrote. “Go there and add a little article. It will take all of five or ten minutes.” And, to Sanger’s surprise, go they did. Within a few days, Wikipedia outstripped Nupedia in terms of quantity, if not quality, and a small community developed. In late January, Sanger created a Wikipedia discussion list (Wikipedia-L) to facilitate discussion of the project. At the end of January, Wikipedia had seventeen “real” articles (entries with more than 200 characters). By the end of February, it had 150; March, 572; April, 835; May, 1,300; June, 1,700; July, 2,400; August, 3,700. At the end of the year, the site boasted approximately 15,000 articles and about 350 “Wikipedians.”

### Example 2

Landow gives his own example to support Foucault's notion that "author" means more than mere "writer", but is laden with social ideas about "power" and "authority" which affects how a society and culture operates.

On p. 139 Landow reports that an anecdote about how the University of British Columbia refused to consider co-authored works for promotion. 

Here we might ask, in the manner of Foucault, is the university merely "responding" to some natural idea about the important independent genius of the author (Authors = "individuals" who individually write books)? Or conversely, is the institution itself helping to construct the idea of authorship, defining the rules of when someone gets to be counted as an "author" and when a textual work ought to count as being an "authored work" (with all the prestige and importance that this implies)?


Landow writes: 

> "but now I wish to point out that as scholars from McLuhan and Eisenstein to Ede and Lunsford have long argued, book technology and the attitudes it supports are the institutions most responsible for maintaining **exaggerated** notions of authorial individuality, uniqueness, and ownership that often drastically **falsify** the conception of original contributions in the humanities and convey **distorted** pictures of research." (p. 140)

This quotation introduces evaluative language ("exaggerated", "falsify", "distorted"). The suggestion is that the idea of authorship that our institutions and dominant media construct are not harmless, but have an effect on our ability to accurately see the world. 

So, here we might ask: 

{:.rquestion}
What are some of the consequences of this "exaggeration"?  Why do we care?

One answer among many might be...

Book technologies (and supporting institutions) that construct or perpetuate the idea of the isolated author have produced corresponding reward systems. Scholars looking to get jobs, keep jobs, and get promotions then must play into this game. 

The result is a "publishing mill" that generates, at best, redundancy, and more likely, a lot of nonsense. 

Considering this [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0701/0701012.pdf) which suggests ([not without controversy and disagreement](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/04/23/academic-papers-citation-rates-remler/)) that "nearly 90% of papers in academic journals are never cited". While this number may be high, it suggests that much of what "authors" are producing to keep their jobs and get promoted is never read or used.

At the same consider how these same evaluation and promotion standards might be devaluing other kinds of valuable knowledge activities; perhaps more dialogical activities like teaching, dialogue, public lecturing, collaborative projects, translation, editing of primary texts, etc.

Another example might be the way sole authorship creates an exaggerated idea of property, i.e. intellectual property, which negatively affects future research progress. As "ideas" are transformed into property, laws of property begin to control and exclude how others might absorb and use these, once common, but now privately owned ideas. (See Landow, bottom of pg. 140)

Hypertext authorship often challenges or complicates this.

For example: Is it possible to see this conflict in the construction of our own class annotations on articles, many of which are technically still in copyright?

Our annotations are tethered to the anchoring text, but at the same time our annotations are not the property of the original author. 

However, if we remove the underlying article, our annotations are less powerful and meaningful. As hypertext writers become co-dependent, do we also become co-owners? Or conversely, do copyright laws end up privileging one kind of writing, while diminishing or threatening another form. 

In general, I would say intellectual property laws do not handle these new situations well, precisely they have been invented for a world where one kind of writing was dominant. Now that a new technology has emerged where a new kind of writing is possible, we find that these laws are not adapting well to the new context. (We will see this issue of copyright and intellectual property emerge again when we read Lessig later in the Semester.)

## Landow and the possibilities of hypertext writing

Finally let's end with just a little bit of reflection on what hypertext writing might look like according to Landow. 

<div class="discussion" markdown="1">

In the section title "How the Print Author Differs from the Hypertext Author" (pp. 131-135)...

<span class="respond"> What are some of things that Landow thinks the "hypertext" writers can do that the traditional writer cannot? Why does he see these as positive?
</div>

<!-- ## In Sum: The Post Structuralists Critique

Let's step back now and look and Landow's overview of post-structuralists critique of the the author and consider how the "hypertext" might address some of these issues and open up new possibilities.

What does a focus on authorship (perhaps encouraged by the medium of the book) seem to "center the self"? 

According to Landow, why do post-structuralists like Lyotard sometimes think of this a de-centering of the self (p. 127)

Why does Lyotard (and Barthes, Foucault, and Derrida, Deleuze, p. 130) think there is something wrong or distorted about the center self? What do we miss if we see the world this way? What do we understand by seeing the self as de-centered?

[Lytoard qt on pg. 127 could be helpful here; rejects self as island, self as something that emerges from connections. 
"A person is located a nodal points...located a post". 

This article might be helpful as well: http://rjelal.com/2.2.14/152-156.pdf (discusses meaning as the product of chains of difference. Thus the meaning is constructed by reader through previous associations) Thus the readers is a kind of author here.  p. 128 bottom Levi-Strauss quote is along the same lines.

In short, these philosophers would say that a focus a stark separation between author and readers gives a false impression of our selves, what we are, and how we think of ourselves. A decentered self, helps us recognize ourselves as being constituted and dependent on our connections and relations.  -->

<!-- **Example** 

A good example of this in metaphysics might be whether a individual is constituted by an unchanging essence or particular set of properties. 

Another example is the identification of authority in semantic web or wikipedia. 

What the authoritative id is there some person name is correct or could the correct name emerge from practice. 

So the "entity" is distinguishable by a clustering of references.

Is wikipedia correct because wikipedia says so, or because enough people relate themselves to it positively. 

Are you "Jeff" because you are Jeff or because enough people relate to you as Jeff. With a critical mass the "name" has an effect of drawing your attention, the name "works", the name has meaning.
---  -->

<!-- ## Reconfiguration and Hyperlink

Landow mentions "Three Forms" of reconfiguration of author that are possible through the use of hyperlinked texts. Let's consider each of these in turn. 

Form 1

Form 2 

Form 3 Third form is mentioned on p. 130: "the decentered self" (But i can't find the first two forms.)

Good summary quote from Landow: 

> No, I make this point to remind us that, as Derrida emphasizes, the linear habits of thought associated with print technology often influence us to think in particular ways that require narrowness, decontextualization, and intel-lectual attenuation, if not downright impoverishment. Linear argument, in other words, forces one to cut off a quoted passage from other, apparently irrelevant contexts that in fact contribute to its meaning. The linearity of print also provides the passage with an illusory center whose force is intensified by such selection. (p. 132) -->



<!-- # Foucault

According to Foucault. 
How market conditions surrounding the book have contributed to a particular idea of "authorship"? (See Landow p. 139)

Landow example, p. 139 (https://hyp.is/2AmglNK7Eeq2OU-7ZPTZ9g/s3.amazonaws.com/lum-faculty-jcwitt-public/pl399/Landow_2006_Reconfiguring_the_Author,_chapter_4.pdf) University of British Columbia refuses to consider co-authored works for promotion. (Is this an effect of thinking about authorship (and its value) in a particular way. Or are the institutions helping to construct an idea of authorship, when someone is an author and when they are not? Or is it a circular spiral.)

Landow that mentions McLuhan and Einstein who "book technology and the attitudes it supports are the institutions most responsible for maintaining exaggerated notions notions of authorial individuality. 

**Example/Illustrations**
What are some of the consequences of this "exaggeration" 

Why do we care? Exaggeration sounds negative, so what's the problem? 

Well, in privileging some activities others might be devalued, while the privileged activity might be taken to a privileged extreme. 

Consider for example the citation rates for publications academia and especially in the humanities. 

(add citation statistics here.)

It seems the book technologies that construct or perpetuate the idea of the isolated author have produced corresponding reward systems. Scholars looking to get jobs, keep jobs, and get promotions then must play into this game. 

The result is a "publishing mill" that generates at best redundancy and more likely a lot of nonsense, while devaluing other kinds of knowledge activities, perhaps more dialogical ones like teaching, dialogue, public lecturing, collaborative projects, translation, editing of primary texts, etc.

(Landow, bottom of pg. 140)
Books also create the fictional idea of "sole property" and the modern idea of "intellectual property". 

Good quotation from David Bolter

Hypertext challenges that. Is it possible to see this in the construction of our annotations on articles, many of which are technically in copyright. Our annotations are tethered to the anchored text, but our annotations are not the property of the original author, but remove the underlying article and our annotations are less powerful and meaningful. We've become co-dependent, and perhaps co-owners, something intellectual properties laws do not handle well. (We will see this issue emerge again when we read Lessig.) -->




<!-- ## Are annotators authors?
